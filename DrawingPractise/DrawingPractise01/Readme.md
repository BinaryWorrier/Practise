Overview 

The Page class has a pencil & a Draw method.  
The pencil can draw a single pointon the page.  
The smile class shows that something can be drawn on the page.  
You should ignore everything EXCEPT the page.cs, PaintBox.cs & IPantBox.cs files.  

To Do  
We need a Set of tools in our paint box  
Eg don't want to execute a loop every time we want to draw a line.  
we want a single method we can call to draw a line.  

Implement the 3 methods in the PaintBox class, to  
a. Draw a line  
b. Draw a rectangle  
c. Draw a circle.  

1. In Page, stop the smile from drawing
2. Then, in page
3. When you can draw a line, draw a black line from (10, 10) to (10, 30) and a blue line from (10, 40) to (10, 100) 
4. When you can draw a black rectangle, draw a square 20 on a side, from 30, 30
5. When you can draw a circle, draw a red circle centred on 100, 100 with a radius of 30

NB: The Smile class draws a (wonky) smiley face without using lines, circles or rectangles, DO NOT look to it for inspiration.  

P.S you will need to use the Math functions to calculate Sin and Cos for the X & Y points in the circle.  
If your secondary school maths aren't up to scratch I can help you through it  
HINT: The Math Sin & Cos functions work on Radians, not degrees.  
To convert an angle from Degrees to radiants . . . Radiant = PI * Degree / 180
